"""Numerically defensive helpers for degenerate inputs.

APGI analyses routinely run on series that can be constant or near-constant —
a threshold that never moves, an ignition train with no ignitions, a
subthreshold run with zero variance. NumPy and LAPACK signal these cases with
warnings (``invalid value encountered in divide``, ``Mean of empty slice``) or,
for LAPACK, with text written straight to stderr (``On entry to DLASCL,
parameter number 4 had an illegal value``) that no Python warning filter can
intercept.

The previous approach was to silence those warnings wholesale in ``pytest.ini``
and via ``warnings.filterwarnings`` at import time. That hid the degeneracy
rather than handling it: a correlation of NaN would flow onward and be reported
as a result. These helpers detect the degenerate case up front and return an
explicit, documented value instead.
